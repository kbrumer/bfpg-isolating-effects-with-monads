/*
 * We can get rid of the mutable error global by making each event map to a
 * tuple that holds list of errors and the resulting pretty printed line. That
 * way we can generate all of our error lines and append them all together at
 * the end.
 *
 * This only really works because we were already collecting a list. If our
 * log lines were a different shape to our output (say we're logging a list of
 * lines but only returning a single result) we'd be forcing the caller of our
 * functions to join the resulting lists for us at each level, which is hideous.
 *
 * This appending ( |+| ) is done with the magic of the monoid typeclass which
 * includes a zero element (in the list case, this is nil) and an append
 * operation (in the case of a list, this is ++). Using the monoid append here
 * is useless because we already know that we're dealing with a list, but seeing
 * it here demonstrates how scalaz manages the next step.
 *
 * The writer monad was written to solve this append only state problem. We'll
 * see this in the next step!
